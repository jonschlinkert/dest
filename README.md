# dest [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dest.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/dest)

> Customized implementation of the dest method from vinyl.

Nothing to see yet. This is an experiment to create a `dest` plugin for [template](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/template) with the following options:

* [x] `streams`: (this is the default, it's basically just a vinyl adapter that will be a slimmed-down alternative to `vfs.dest`.)
* [ ] `promise`
* [ ] `sync`
* [ ] `async`

TODO:

* links to vinyl, bluebird, other libs...

## Install

```sh
$ npm i dest --save
```

## Usage
