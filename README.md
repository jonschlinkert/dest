# dest [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dest.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/dest)

> Plugin for Template, for writing a file to the file system.

Nothing to see yet. This is an experiment to create a `dest` plugin for [template](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/template) with the following options:

* [x] `streams`: (this is the default, it's basically just a vinyl adapter that is a slimmed-down alternative to `vfs.dest`.)
* [ ] `promise`
* [ ] `sync`
* [ ] `async`

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i dest --save
```

## Usage

```js
var dest = require('dest');
```

## Running tests

Install dev dependencies:

```sh
$ npm i -d && npm test
```
